# GroupsPuzzleGame
 
A simple puzzle game where you need to find groups of 3 symbols.

A group is defined as a collection of symbols whose attributes either share the same value or all have distinct values.

For example, 3 blue circles would make a group, as do the collections (blue circle, red diamond, green hexagon) and (red circle, red diamond, red hexagon).

On the other hand, (blue circle, blue diamond, red hexagon) is not a group.

2 attributes - color and shape - are implemented as of now.
